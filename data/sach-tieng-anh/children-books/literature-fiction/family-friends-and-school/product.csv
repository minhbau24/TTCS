Get ready for a whole new look into Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid! Introducing the newest Wimpy Kid author—Rowley Jefferson! Rowley’s best friend Greg Heffley has been chronicling his middle-school years in thirteen Diary of a Wimpy Kid journals . . . and counting. But it’s finally time for readers to hear directly from Rowley in a journal of his own. In Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid, Rowley writes about his experiences and agrees to play the role of biographer for Greg along the way. (After all, one day Greg will be rich and famous, and everyone will want to know his life’s story.) But Rowley is a poor choice for the job, and his “biography” of Greg is a hilarious mess. Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson’s Journal offers readers a new way to look at the Wimpy world—one fans won’t want to miss!

But the crazy thing is, he’s innocent. Or at least sort of. The authorities are closing in, but when a surprise blizzard hits, the Heffley family is trapped indoors. Greg knows that when the snow melts he’s going to have to face the music, but could any punishment be worse than being stuck inside with your family for the holidays? A Review Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Jeff Kinney Question: Given all the jobs that you have--game designer, fatherhood, Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie work, etc.,--do you have a certain time that you set aside to write? Kinney: I still treat writing like a hobby, working mostly at night and sometimes on weekends. But when a deadline looms my hobby time gets extended into the wee hours of the night. It's not uncommon for me to work until 4:00 , and I'm usually back at work by 9:00 Q: Did you get to choose which character you would play in the Wimpy Kid films (Mr. Hills)? What do you enjoy most about working on the movies? Kinney: I never any real desire to appear in the Wimpy Kid films, but one day my wife encouraged me to be an extra in one of the crowd scenes. So I walked onto the set, ready to ask the assistant director to put me somewhere in the back. It happened that right at that moment the director was looking for someone to play the role of Mr. Hills, Holly Hills's father. What I didn't realize was that I'd be front and center in the church scene, and in the new movie, I'm even more prominent. I'm incredibly self-conscious so appearing on-camera was a real stretch for me. Q: In 2009 Time magazine named you as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World--what’s the first thing you did after you found out? Kinney: I thought it was a practical joke, so I tried to track down the source of the joke. I eventually reached a voicemail of a reporter who said they worked for Time , and at that point I thought it was just a well-planned practical joke. It took me a while to realize it was for real. It was a big honor, but I don't take it very seriously. I'm the fourth most influential person in my own house. Q: Would you ever consider making Wimpy Kid into a newspaper comic strip or creating another one? Do you have any favorite comic strips that you currently read? Kinney: I've considered it. I set out to become a newspaper cartoonist but failed to break in. But I like the freedom books give me, so it would be tough to cram my ideas into three or four panels. Q: What is (or could be) you motto in life? Kinney: I was inspired to write by a Benjamin Franklin quote: ""Well done is better than well said."" But I always encourage kids to ""create something great,"" because the tools to create something original and find an audience are available to them like never before. Q: What was your favorite year in school, and why? Kinney: Fifth grade was my favorite year. I had a great teacher, Mrs. Norton, who encouraged me to be funny and challenged me to be a better artist and joke-teller than I was. I liked it that she didn't coddle me. Q: Kids now ask for a book that is “like Diary of a Wimpy Kid ,” and with this series you’ve created a whole new subset of books for young readers--how does it feel to be the person behind such massive book enjoyment, reaching reluctant readers, and spawning any number of titles that aspire to be “the next Wimpy Kid ?” Kinney: I'm happy that kids are reading. I think graphical books reach kids who might otherwise see books as work. Books should be fun!

Greg’s main focus as the school year gets under way is replacing his best friend, Rowley, with whom he had a falling out over the summer. Although he has not reached full-blown puberty quite yet, Greg feels as if he’s hit his childhood “expiration date,” and when you’re no longer a cute kid, nothing is as easy as it used to be. Once again, Kinney remains unerringly attuned to the tween psyche as he packs in rapid-fire experiences in words and cartoons that are bust-a-gut funny, beg-to-stay-home-from-school mortifying, and completely authentic in all their ugly truths.

His best friend, Rowley Jefferson, has ditched him, and finding new friends in middle school is proving to be a tough task. To change his fortunes, Greg decides to take a leap of faith and turn his decisions over to chance. Will a roll of the dice turn things around, or is Greg's life destined to be just another hard-luck story? From Booklist Greg Heffley’s eighth adventure (but who’s counting?) centers on his relationship with his best friend, Rowley—more specifically, the demise of that relationship when Rowley gets a girlfriend. At first, Greg tries to insert himself into the mix, but he soon tires of Abigail’s pathological control (she changes Rowley’s hairstyle) and fussy propriety (she won’t let him eat off of the cafeteria floor). And so Greg must navigate the minefield of middle school, with its hero points, dollar-store sneakers, and the looming shadow of summer school, all by himself. Without a sidekick, Greg spends more time at home, suffering the attentions of his “colorful” extended family, like Aunt Audra, who drags him along to a psychic visit. Greg begins consulting Rodrick’s forgotten Magic 8 Ball and thinks maybe that will turn his luck around. As ever, Kinney strikes his comic target in the bull’s-eye, exaggerating the trials of adolescence just enough to make them real while deftly exposing the insecurities behind Greg’s bravado with his super, simple drawings. Will Greg and Rowley make up? Either way, devotees need not worry; there is plenty more angst in store. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Kinney’s books are best-sellers on every list out there, and his rabid fans will be chomping at the bit to get another taste of the Wimpy Kid.

Let’s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg’s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other “manly” endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father’s efforts to change him. But when Greg’s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly -1/19/2009: The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney’s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney’s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year’s Day (he resolves to “help other people improve,” telling his mother, “I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly”) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father’s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg’s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (“Dear James, You smell”), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team’s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the “racket” children’s book authors have going. “All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.” Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.

Stella Grant likes to be in control--even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn't care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he'll turn eighteen and then he'll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals. Will's exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as on Stella, she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn't feel like safety. It feels like punishment. What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too? Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

Sammy Wallach has epic plans for the end of junior year over: Sneak out to the city to see her favorite band. Get crush-worthy Jamie Moss to ask her to prom. Rock all exams (APs and driver's). With a few white lies, some killer flirting, and tons of practice, Sammy's got things covered. That is, until the bank her dad works for is attacked by hacktivists who manage to steal everything in the Wallach family's private cloud, including Sammy's entire digital life. Literally the whole world has access to her emails, texts, photos, and, worst of all, journal. Life. Is. Over. Now Sammy's best friends are furious about things she wrote, Jamie thinks she's desperate, and she can barely show her face at school. Plus, her parents know all the rules she broke. But Sammy's not the only one with secrets -- her family has a few of its own that could change everything. And while the truth might set you free, no one said it was going to be painless.

""A haunting, beautiful, and necessary book that will stay with you long after you've read the last page.""--Nicola Yoon, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Everything, Everything Charlotte Davis is in pieces. At seventeen she's already lost more than most people do in a lifetime. But she's learned how to forget. The broken glass washes away the sorrow until there is nothing but calm. You don't have to think about your father and the river. Your best friend, who is gone forever. Or your mother, who has nothing left to give you. Every new scar hardens Charlie's heart just a little more, yet it still hurts so much. It hurts enough to not care anymore, which is sometimes what has to happen before you can find your way back from the edge. A deeply moving portrait of a girl in a world that owes her nothing, and has taken so much, and the journey she undergoes to put herself back together. Kathleen Glasgow's debut is heartbreakingly real and unflinchingly honest. It's a story you won't be able to look away from. ""Girl, Interrupted meets Speak.""--R ""A dark yet powerful read.""--PasteM ""One of the most affecting novels we have read.""--G ""Breathtaking and beautifully written.""--Bustle ""Intimate and gritty.""--The Irish Times And don't miss Kathleen Glasgow's newest novel How to Make Friends with the Dark, on shelves spring 2019, about a girl who deals with love, loss, and learning to cope when you feel like you're surrounded by darkness.

A mainstay on the New York Times Best Sellers List, Big Nate is now the star of his own musical, which debuted in spring 2013. Aspiring cartoonist Nate Wright is the star of Big Nate, the daily and Sunday comic strip, which has been nationally syndicated since 1991. Nate is 11 years old, four-and-a-half feet tall, and the all-time record holder for detentions in school history. He's a self-described genius and sixth grade Renaissance Man. Nate, who lives with his dad and older sister, enjoys pestering his family and teachers with his sarcasm. To draw Big Nate, Peirce relies on memories of his own childhood and the experiences he collected teaching art at a New York City high school. Peirce occasionally turns his pen over to his creation, and readers get to see life through Nate's eyes as he doodles his adventures in his notebook.

Greg’s main focus as the school year gets under way is replacing his best friend, Rowley, with whom he had a falling out over the summer. Although he has not reached full-blown puberty quite yet, Greg feels as if he’s hit his childhood “expiration date,” and when you’re no longer a cute kid, nothing is as easy as it used to be. Once again, Kinney remains unerringly attuned to the tween psyche as he packs in rapid-fire experiences in words and cartoons that are bust-a-gut funny, beg-to-stay-home-from-school mortifying, and completely authentic in all their ugly truths. Grades 5-8. --Andrew Medlar Greg Heffley has always been in a hurry to grow up. But is getting older really all it’s cracked up to be? Greg suddenly finds himself dealing with the pressures of boy-girl parties, increased responsibilities, and even the awkward changes that come with getting older—all without his best friend, Rowley, at his side. Can Greg make it through on his own? Or will he have to face the “ugly truth”? Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

When a deadly plague reaches the small fish camp where he lives, an orphan named Leif is forced to take to the water in a cedar canoe. He flees northward, following a wild, fjord-riven shore, thrown from one danger to the next, unsure of his destination. Yet the deeper into his journey he paddles, the closer Leif comes to his truest self as he connects to the heartbeat of the ocean, the pulse of the sea. A stunning historical adventure with hints of Nordic mythology and an irresistible narrative pull, Northwind is Gary Paulsen at his captivating, adventuresome best.

It started when his dad went to prison and now he can't seem to stop. When Ed's younger brother, Sam, goes missing one day under his supervision, nobody believes him when he says he can't remember what happened. Things begin to go very wrong for Ed's family when his mother loses her job and they have to start using a food bank.

Their experiences with bullying are shared through David's first-person account, which is filled with cartoon-style illustrations throughout. David and Michael are understood only by David's grandfather. The boys' bond with Grandpa Johnny is heartwarming. Problems with divorced parents and foster parents are addressed but only in passing. Many of the boys' attempts to impress classmates are chuckle-worthy, and readers will laugh at their made-up words and cheer on these two likable boys and their friend Anna Brittannica. Unlike other books about bullying, this one offers alternative solutions to handling everyday situations—for instance, the boys often calmly respond, ""Uh huh, right back atcha!"" The simple lessons will speak to bullies and bullied alike. The title may deter some adults, but kids will embrace the silliness and enjoy this relatable tale. VERDICT A solid addition to collections serving upper middle grade and middle school readers. Hand to fans of goofy, realistic school stories.—Elizabeth Swartz, Warrior Run School District, PA Review Praise for Pottymouth and Stoopid : An instant New York Times bestseller! An IndieBound bestseller! ""I have one word for this book: SUPERWONDERRIFIC!"" ― Jerry Spinelli, Newberry Medal-winning author of Maniac Magee and Stargirl ""This book is light and mighty. Funny and honest. And, in the words of one kid (who lives in my house), 'It's like he wrote about the people in my school (minus the limos and flufferknuckles, of course). Pottymouth and Stoopid is really, really good."" ― Kwame Alexander, Newberry Medal-winning author of The Crossover ""A deeply satisfying twist that turns two seventh-graders haunted by nicknames bestowed in preschool into culture heroes. Readers will applaud as the two best buds find themselves at the head of a veritable army of geeks and brains with similarly disparaging nicknames. 'Awesometastic!'"" ― Booklist ""Patterson and Grabenstein, the team behind the I Funny series, introduce two beleaguered but resilient seventh graders. As the boys struggle with their unfair reputations, the authors tackle bullies, unexpected friendships, and family troubles with comedy and poignancy. Gilpin's cartoons build on the story's many jokes, interludes from classmates and family members flesh out the boys' world, and the friends' hard-fought victory feels very well earned.""― Publisher's Weekly ""Pottymouth and Stoopid take on bullies and tough times with friendship and the power of funny!"" ― Eric Kahn Gale, author of The Bully Book ""Readers can't help but laugh at the antics David and Michael perform, but through their story, readers are shown that the worst bullying is not always physical.""― School Library Connection ""Readers will be amused by Pottymouth and Stoopid's shenanigans [...] Entertaining.""― Kirkus ""A funny, poignant tale of two quirky boys who suffer from years of endless teasing. Pottymouth and Stoopid triumph in the end, but only after reminding us how painful bullying can be. Boys are going to love this story."" ― Dr. Michael Thompson, New York Times bestselling co-author of Raising Cain ""Silly, insightful and triumphant...You'll remember this book and these boys for a long time."" ― Carrie Jones, New York Times bestelling author of the Need series, Time Stoppers, and co-editor of Dear Bully Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

Nikki Maxwell has been doing everything she can to keep everyone at school from learning the truth--that she's there on scholarship in exchange for her Dad working as the school's exterminator. The last thing Nikki needs is having her friends and--worst case scenario--her crush, Brandon, associating her with the humongous roach on top of her Dad's van! Now it looks like her secret could be about to come out, and Nikki's willing to go to any zany and wacky length to prevent that from happening. The timing seems perfect when a major talent competition is announced with a school scholarship offered as the top prize. Nikki loves to sing and dance and now she gets to have tons of fun with her friends while competing for a chance to free her Dad from his obligation! (And free herself from all that potential damage to her reputation . . .) Once again, hijinks and misunderstandings aplenty ensue, as well as more hilarious and heartwarming moments with Nikki and her friends. Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

Charity Brown's life is about to change - her family have been left a huge, rambling house by a mysterious benefactor, and her parents want to move in and throw open its doors to the needy. Only recently back from hospital after months of isolation with polio, Charity is over-protected and lonely as the only child still at home. Her family are very religious - her sisters are called Faith and Hope, and her brother Ted is studying to be a preacher - so she's both excited and nervous at the thought of sharing her family and new home with strangers.

This middle grade novel is an excellent choice for tween readers in grades 5 to 6, especially during homeschooling. It’s a fun way to keep your child entertained and engaged while not in the classroom. Amelia Albright dreams about going to Florida for spring break like everyone else in her class, but her father—a cranky and stubborn English professor—has decided Florida is too much adventure. Now Amelia is stuck at home with him and her babysitter, the beloved Mrs. O’Brien. The week ahead promises to be boring, until Amelia meets Casey at her neighborhood art studio. Amelia has never been friends with a boy before, and the experience is both fraught and thrilling. When Casey claims to see the spirit of Amelia’s mother (who died ten years before), the pair embarks on an altogether different journey in their attempt to find her. Using crisp, lyrical, literary writing and moments of humor and truth, award-winning author Kevin Henkes deftly captures how it feels to be almost thirteen. With themes of family, death, grief, creativity, and loyalty, Sweeping Up the Heart is for readers of Kate DiCamillo, Rebecca Stead, Lauren Wolk, Kimberly Brubaker Bradley, and Pam Muñoz Ryan.

All he wants is to launch his golden iPod into space the way Carl Sagan (the man, not the dog) launched his Golden Record on the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. From Colorado to New Mexico, Las Vegas to L.A., Alex records a journey on his iPod to show other lifeforms what life on earth, his earth, is like. But his destination keeps changing. And the funny, lost, remarkable people he meets along the way can only partially prepare him for the secrets he'll uncover--from the truth about his long-dead dad to the fact that, for a kid with a troubled mom and a mostly not-around brother, he has way more family than he ever knew. Jack Cheng's debut is full of joy, optimism, determination, and unbelievable heart. To read the first page is to fall in love with Alex and his view of our big, beautiful, complicated world. To read the last is to know he and his story will stay with you a long, long time.

The...","Diary Of A Wimpy Kid - The Long Haul NEW YORK, NY, March 20, 2014—ABRAMS revs up its engines to announce that its Amulet Books imprint will publish Diary of a Wimpy Kid book 9 on November 4, 2014. The new book in the phenomenally successful series written and illustrated by Jeff Kinney—which has sold more than 120 million copies around the world—will also be published globally in more than 80 countries. The new Diary of a Wimpy Kid book will be one of the most anticipated releases of the year in both the United States and internationally. Diary of a Wimpy Kid book 9 will go on sale in the United States on November 4, 2014. The United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, New Zealand, Turkey, Greece, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Portugal, and Norway will release the book in their respective territories—83 countries in total—just after the U.S. debut. A striking, original new image by Jeff Kinney (above), featuring Greg Heffley and his family on a typical road trip by car, has been released to tease fans about what’s to come in the new book. “For the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, I’m taking the Heffleys out of their home environment and sending them out on the road,” says Kinney. “Writing about an epic family road trip has really got my creative juices flowing, and I think this could be the funniest book yet.” Following major publicity, marketing, and social-media promotions in the U.S. for the November 2014 release, the international partners will launch their respective campaigns around the world as fans cheer for the arrival of the newest Diary of a Wimpy Kid story. Published in 2007, the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid book was an instant bestseller, and just a year later more than 100,000 copies were in print in the U.S. alone. With each subsequent book, in-print numbers continue to grow exponentially both here and abroad, to a combined 120 million copies by the time the eighth book, Hard Luck , went on sale in 2013. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck was the highest-selling book of 2013—for adults or children—in the United States, topping more than 3.2 million copies. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series has been a fixture on the USA Today bestseller list (the first book in the series remained in the top 150 for more than 200 weeks) and is also on the Wall Street Journal and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. The series has remained consistently on the New York Times bestseller lists since the publication of the first book. The books have been sold in 48 different editions in 44 languages. Published by Amulet Books, an imprint of ABRAMS, Kinney’s work has been widely praised for its ability to turn reluctant readers on to books. Kinney was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in the world. Three movies based on the book series have grossed more than $250 million internationally. The book series won Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards in 2010, 2011, and 2012 (and is nominated for one for 2013), and Kinney won a Children’s Choice Book Award in 2012. Books in the series have won numerous awards voted on by students and teachers around the globe. The Wimpy Kid island (Wimpy Wonderland) on , a virtual world for kids, remains one of the most visited on the site. Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

Proper laughs!' Pamela Butchart ______________________________ A laugh-out-loud young fiction series from bestselling author Joanna Nadin, perfect for fans of Horrid Henry. According to head teacher Mrs Bottomley-Blunt, 4B is the WORST CLASS IN THE WORLD. She says school is not about footling or fiddle-faddling or FUN. It is about LEARNING and it is high time 4B tried harder to EXCEL at it. But Stanley and Manjit didn't LITERALLY mean to make their whole class sick with homemade biscuits. And they definitely didn't LITERALLY mean for Manjit's dog Killer to eat their teacher's shoes or for Bruce Bingley's rat to escape. These things just happened even though they had a FOOLPROOF plan. You see, 4B may be the WORST CLASS IN THE WORLD. But you wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Highly illustrated and featuring two hilarious madcap adventures in one book, these books are just right for children ready for their first chapter books.

Davey Wexler has never felt so alone. Her father has just been killed--shot in a holdup at the 7-Eleven near their home. And now her mother has transplanted her and her little brother, Jason, to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to stay with family and recover. But Davey is withdrawn, full of rage and fear and loneliness. Then one day, while exploring a canyon, she meets an older boy who calls himself Wolf. Wolf is the only one who understands her--the only one who can read her sad eyes. And he is the one who helps her realize that she must find a way to move forward with her life. Davey is one of Judy Blume's most hauntingly true human beings, capturing the deep ways a person can change that can't be seen--only felt. Her story has been felt, deeply, by readers for decades.
