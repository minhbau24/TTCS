The gap between the richest and the poorest Americans has been growing for decades, and experts predict it will continue to widen. Young people bear the brunt of this inequality because it makes it harder to get a job and to pay for the college education you need to move up the ladder. Political changes could help close the gap, but in the meantime, teens can help prepare themselves for financial independence. In this book, teens write about learning to handle money wisely, to manage their own income, to pay for college, and how our larger economic system determines their financial standing. Through these essays, teen readers—as well as their parents, teachers, and caregivers—will pick up new tricks to managing their money but will also be provided a much-needed glimpse into how the world looks to our younger generations.

Companies like Kate Spade and Macy’s have brought her in to teach “the Code.” Inc. magazine named Girl Code one of the “Top 9 Inspiring Books Every Female Entrepreneur Should Read” alongside Lean In, #Girlboss, and Thrive. A few years ago, I made a crazy claim in the first edition of Girl Code: that in today’s competitive marketplace, the fiercest thing a female entrepreneur can do is to support other women. Something dynamic happens when women genuinely show up for each other. When we lose the facades, cut the bullsh*t, and truly have each other’s backs. When we stop pretending everything is perfect, and show the messy, beautiful parts of ourselves and our work—which all look awfully similar. When we talk about our fears, our missteps, and our breakdowns. And most importantly, when we share our celebrations, our breakthroughs, and our solutions. I’m convinced that there’s no reason to hoard information, connections, or insight. Wisdom is meant to be shared, so let’s start sharing what we’ve learned to make each other better. Let’s start building each other up. Let’s live up to our potential and start ruling the world. Girl Code is a roadmap for female entrepreneurs, professional women, “side hustlers” (those with a day job plus a part-time small business), and any­one in between. This book won’t teach you how to build a multimillion-dollar company. It won’t teach you about systems or finance. But it will teach you how to build confidence in yourself, reconnect with your “why,” eradicate jealousy, and ultimately learn the power of connection. Because at the end of the day, that’s what life and business are all about. Giá sản phẩm trên Tiki đã bao gồm thuế theo luật hiện hành.

From the way we are managed to the rewards we receive, all aspects of our work life are determined by the changing dynamics of the workplace. Recent concerns about globalisation, productivity and the introduction of new technologies have raised questions about the future of the workforce and job security. But are these concerns really justified? 21st Century Workforces and Workplaces charts, explains and analyses the past five years, which has seen the rewriting of much of what we thought we knew about employment and how workplaces respond to pressure. The book also outlines what hasn't changed and, in doing so, distinguishes myth from reality. Stephen Bevan, Ian Brinkley, Zofia Bajorek and Cary L. Cooper combine their considerable expertise to discuss the critical questions for any member of any workplace, including: · Are permanent, long-term jobs a thing of the past? · Does work have to be a 'place'? · How will future managers be selected, educated and developed? · What is the future for trade unions? · Beyond pay, how will rewards evolve to incentivise workers alongside responsible capitalism? · Are we seeing the end of retirement? This book takes what we know and projects how the future labour market will develop. 21st Century Workforces and Workplaces asks what sort of work environments we want to see in 2025 and what we can do today to help bring about the necessary changes.

This new title looks at how organizations and their leaders can adapt to an increasingly volatile and uncertain operating environment through the 4 Cs: Creativity, Critical reflection, Communication and Collaboration. Based on extensive research in both the education and business sectors, the authors show how the 4 Cs can be embedded and enacted in many different types of organizations to make them more effective and responsive to emerging challenges, threats and opportunities. The book makes clear links between leading and learning, because leadership is no longer (if it ever was) just a role for CEOs, CFOs and senior managers. For organizations to be flexible and agile in the 21st century, the majority of the employees must exercise leadership – something that can only happen if learning is standard feature of that leadership, AND incorporates key 21st century skills (the 4 Cs themselves). However, there is a marked gap between companies knowing what they should do in order to 'be flexible', 'be creative' and 'have clear channels of communication', and how to make that happen in reality. Written for those who have become disillusioned or frustrated with business practices that cannot meet the fast-moving demands of the 21st century, Transforming Organizations provides evidence and inspiration for doing business differently. The strategies and approaches discussed have been taken from the authors' work in real businesses, both large and small, and are supplemented by a number of illustrative case studies.
