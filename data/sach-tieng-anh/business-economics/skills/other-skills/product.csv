Whether you're suffering from work-induced high blood pressure, depression, migraines, or panic attacks, Dr Ellie Cannon has the answer - and it's not quitting your job. We all have a moan about going to work: groaning about getting on the bus in the rush hour, counting down to the weekend. A gripe here and there is understandable and expected, but what happens when your job is making you mentally or physically unwell? When you are in this situation, it can be very difficult to know where to turn, who to speak to or where to find good quality help and advice. In Is Your Job Making You Ill?, Dr Ellie Cannon uses her decade of experience treating patients to create an essential resource for anybody suffering from job-related ill-health. Part one of the book lays out the key causes of job-related illness - from the pressure of an unmanageable workload to the challenges of an emotionally-draining job - and identifies the most common illnesses and symptoms which can occur as a result, including stress, anxiety, insomnia, high blood pressure and IBS. Part two will help you to find a way out. It includes a practical, self-directed programme that can be tailored to your individual circumstances, covering everything from where to find help, when (and if) to seek professional advice or take time off work, to micro-actions like improving your commute and adjusting your diet to support a healthy lifestyle. Work-related ill health can happen to anyone. This book is all about how to survive and thrive when it happens to you. Don't let your job rule your life anymore.

Based on nine years of research, buttressed by rigorous analysis and infused with engaging stories, Collins and his colleague, Morten Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times. The new study Great by Choice distinguishes itself from Collins’s prior work by its focus not just on performance, but also on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today. With a team of more than twenty researchers, Collins and Hansen studied companies that rose to greatness—beating their industry indexes by a minimum of ten times over fifteen years—in environments characterized by big forces and rapid shifts that leaders could not predict or control. The research team then contrasted these “10X companies” to a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to achieve greatness in similarly extreme environments. The new findings The study results were full of provocative surprises. Such as: The best leaders were not more risk taking, more visionary, and more creative than the comparisons; they were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid. Innovation by itself turns out not to be the trump card in a chaotic and uncertain world; more important is the ability to scale innovation, to blend creativity with discipline. Following the belief that leading in a “fast world” always requires “fast decisions” and “fast action” is a good way to get killed. The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies. The authors challenge conventional wisdom with thought-provoking, sticky, and supremely practical concepts. They include: 10Xers; the 20 Mile March; Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs; Leading above the Death Line; Zoom Out , Then Zoom In ; and the SMaC Recipe. Finally, in the last chapter, Collins and Hansen present their most provocative and original analysis: defining, quantifying, and studying the role of luck. The great companies and the leaders who built them were not luckier than the comparisons, but they did get a higher Return on Luck. This book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness.

Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our ""two minds""—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. The best news is that ""emotional literacy"" is not fixed early in life. Every parent, every teacher, every business leader, and everyone interested in a more civil society, has a stake in this compelling vision of human possibility.
